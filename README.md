# Logistic Regression with Newton-Raphson Method

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, `Logistic Regression with Newton Raphson (1).ipynb`, which demonstrates how to implement logistic regression using the Newton-Raphson method for optimization. This approach provides insights into more advanced methods of fitting logistic regression models beyond standard gradient descent techniques.

## Features

- In-depth explanation of the Newton-Raphson method applied to logistic regression.
- Step-by-step implementation details.
- Visualizations of the fitting process and results.
- Comparison with other logistic regression fitting methods (if included).

## Installation

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy ipython jupyter
